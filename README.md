# Keystroke-Logging-Demonstration

## Overview
This project is an **educational keystroke logging demonstration** created to help beginners understand the **conceptual working of keyloggers** in a **safe and ethical manner**.  
It does **not** capture system-level keyboard input and does **not** perform any malicious activity.

---

## Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand how keylogging attacks work at a high level
- To learn attacker workflow for cybersecurity awareness
- To study how such attacks can be detected and prevented
- To follow ethical hacking and legal cybersecurity practices

---

## How It Works (Conceptual)
- A simple GUI application accepts user input
- Only text entered inside the application is logged
- Logged data is stored locally for demonstration
- No background monitoring or OS-level keylogging is used

This approach allows safe learning without violating security policies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- Basic file handling
